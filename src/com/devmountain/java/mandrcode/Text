//video for parameters with getter methods and formatting and builder

Avoid booleans -> look for ways to split the method instead
//magic numbers

Throw IllegalArgumentException or IllegalState
.isNotEmpty()

//return early
//avoid nesting with ternary operations

Within catch blocks do two things:

Log error
	log.error(e);
Re-throw it and pass all useful information to the exception
	throw new CustomException(e);

Avoid exceptions in finally
Or try{} with resources mechanism
