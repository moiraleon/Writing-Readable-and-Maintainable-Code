//separating and having more small classes with single responsibilities is best,
//best options can be to split into smaller classes or to rename classes
//keep class names short, simple, and basic
//ideally 1-2 words
//booleans should be prefaced with "is" ie isActive isValid
//camel case, or all caps with _underscores for constants
//never name variables with single letter ie d vs data
//for methods name should give insight on intent and functionality
//avoid abbreviations
//avoid and or if in method names, if present in methods they should be broken into separate methods
